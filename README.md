## About Me

Hi, I’m Lera, a front-end developer focused on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

---

## Here on GitHub, I share:

- ♟ Chess-inspired algorithms and decision-making simulations  
- 🎮 Mini games and gamified web experiments  
- 🕵️ Steganography experiments and encoding tricks  
- 🕹 Interactive visualizations of graph theory, Markov chains, or game theory  
- 🤖 Simple AI/ML prototypes and neural network experiments

## 🚀 Projects

| Repository | Link | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| **My Portfolio** | (https://valeriiaanisimova.github.io/Portfolio-/) |
| **game-of-probabilities** | (https://valeriiaanisimova.github.io/game-of-probabilities/) | An interactive educational game that teaches probability and combinatorics through mini-games with dice, coins, and other simulations. |
| **probability** | (https://valeriiaanisimova.github.io/probability/) | An interactive tool to calculate simple, conditional, dependent, and joint probabilities using custom events and datasets. |
| **fractals-live** | (https://valeriiaanisimova.github.io/fractals-live/) | Interactive fractal generator where users can create and explore live fractal patterns. |
| **fractals-project** | (https://valeriiaanisimova.github.io/fractals-project/) | Interactive fractal tree visualization for managing and exploring personal contacts with significance levels, roles, and statuses. |
| **poker-game** | (https://valeriiaanisimova.github.io/poker-game/) | A dice-based poker game where players roll up to three times per turn to form five-dice combinations. Features multiple game modes, hints, automatic scoring, and team play in a space-themed interface. |
| **Markov_chains** | (https://valeriiaanisimova.github.io/Markov_chains/) | A Snake game where the snake learns to play using Markov chains, adapting its moves probabilistically based on previous successes. | 
| **game_theory** | (https://valeriiaanisimova.github.io/game_theory/) | Interactive game theory simulations illustrating strategies, Nash equilibria, and decision-making in classic games like Prisoner’s Dilemma and Hawk-Dove. | 
| **Correlation-between-lunar-cycle-and-menstruation** | (https://valeriiaanisimova.github.io/Correlation-between-lunar-cycle-and-menstruation/) | Interactive visualization exploring correlations between the lunar cycle and menstrual cycles, allowing users to analyze synchronization patterns across participants. | 
| **compression-game-project** | (https://valeriiaanisimova.github.io/compression-game-project/) | An interactive web game where players use data compression techniques to solve puzzles and optimize files. |
| **compression-project** | (https://valeriiaanisimova.github.io/compression-project/) | interactive web app that turns text into music, rhythms, and pixel art using data compression algorithms like Huffman coding and RLE. | 
| **-Theory-Of-Graphs-project** | (https://valeriiaanisimova.github.io/-Theory-Of-Graphs-project/) | Interactive graph theory project visualizing and analyzing biorhythm cycles. | 
| **probability-project** | (https://valeriiaanisimova.github.io/probability-project/) | An interactive simulation that uses probability to estimate outcomes of life scenarios based on personal choices and habits. | 


- ⚡When I'm not coding, you might find me **solving a puzzle**, **training for the next tournament**, or **figuring out how to automate a tedious task** (because why not let the computer do the boring stuff? 😎).
